The lesson on the Monday of the 2nd week was about services and resources available on the RMIT library website. During the lesson a guest lecturer who is a librarian came in to inform us about utilities on the RMIT library and some other external resources that would be useful for us throughout our journey at RMIT. Firstly, we were informed of the major information sources which are RMIT library Vietnam and Australia and also Google Scholar. The lecturer also guided us through the user interface of the websites and included tips for advanced searching of information using different types of keywords. She broke down the content of the webpages part by part and let us experienced on it ourselves by asking us to search for a book using the special tips and interface. We then move on to learn how to operate on more specific databases such as LinkedIn Learning and Browzine where we could look for more field specific information. In the second part of the lesson, we moved on to a more serious and important subject which is Plagiarism and Referencing. Plagiarism is a type of academic dishonesty on par with collusion, contract cheating and exam misconduct. It is the act of taking the work of others and using it as if it is your own. As a matter of facts, plagiarism itself is considered a crime, theft to be more specific. Hence, there a drastic measurements taken in order to prevent it. Through the lesson, we learn that there are many types of plagiarism such as intentional, accidental and even plagiarism against an older work of yourself. The lecturer then taught us the solution to prevent plagiarism which is referencing.
Through the Easy Cite section of RMIT library, we learnt about different referencing formats and we even got to analyze a source and try referencing the source ourselves. Although it was just a 3 hours session, we learned many useful things that will benefit us greatly far into the future. We learned how to access and use useful sources of information and how to avoid plagiarism.

The lesson on the Thursday of the 2nd week was about doing research, the benefits and philosophy while doing research and skills that would come in handy while doing so. We started off the lesson with learning the definition of research. Basically, according to Best and Kahn (1998), it is the act of finding answers or information through a systematic and non biased process of analysis on a question and or topic. Next up, we were intruduced to 2 important skills which are induction and deduction. The act of induction is to come up with an answer or information through direct and specific observation of an event or information. On the hand, to deduct something is to come to an assumption through the information given and your own observation. The lecturer then showed us a video demonstating the deduction skill from the show Sherlock from BBC.
