The lesson on the Monday of the 2nd week was about services and resources available on the RMIT library website. During the lesson a guest lecturer who is a librarian came in to inform us about utilities on the RMIT library and some other external resources that would be useful for us throughout our journey at RMIT. Firstly, we were informed of the major information sources which are RMIT library Vietnam and Australia and also Google Scholar. The lecturer also guided us through the user interface of the websites and included tips for advanced searching of information using different types of keywords. She broke down the content of the webpages part by part and let us experienced on it ourselves by asking us to search for a book using the special tips and interface. We then move on to learn how to operate on more specific databases such as LinkedIn Learning and Browzine where we could look for more field specific information. In the second part of the lesson, we moved on to a more serious and important subject which is Plagiarism and Referencing. Plagiarism is a type of academic dishonesty on par with collusion, contract cheating and exam misconduct. It is the act of taking the work of others and using it as if it is your own. As a matter of facts, plagiarism itself is considered a crime, theft to be more specific. Hence, there a drastic measurements taken in order to prevent it. Through the lesson, we learn that there are many types of plagiarism such as intentional, accidental and even plagiarism against an older work of yourself. The lecturer then taught us the solution to prevent plagiarism which is referencing.
Through the Easy Cite section of RMIT library, we learnt about different referencing formats and we even got to analyze a source and try referencing the source ourselves. Although it was just a 3 hours session, we learned many useful things that will benefit us greatly far into the future. We learned how to access and use useful sources of information and how to avoid plagiarism.

The lesson on the Thursday of the 2nd week was about doing research, the benefits and philosophy while doing research and skills that would come in handy while doing so. We started off the lesson with learning the definition of research. Basically, according to Best and Kahn (1998), it is the act of finding answers or information through a systematic and non biased process of analysis on a question and or topic. Next up, we were introduced to 2 important skills which are induction and deduction. The act of induction is to come up with an answer or information through direct and specific observation of an event or information. On the hand, to deduct something is to come to an assumption through the information given and your own observation. The lecturer then showed us a video demonstrating the deduction skill from the show Sherlock from BBC. We then proceeded to look back on our experiences on the 2 skills and shared it amongst each other. On the next part of the lesson we learnt about research ethics. The lecturer showed us the things we can't and should do while conducting research. Firstly, we can't show dishonesty to obtain favourable results such as forging, trimming and cooking. Secondly, we should show credit and authorship of reference of previously done researches to avoid plagiarism. Thirdly, we should stop conducting the research if there is a conflict of interest to avoid biased opinions. Next up, we shouldn't harm anyone or anything in the name of research. Last but not least, we should be mindful that the research or its result can have visible impacts on our society (Kevin 2022). In the last part of the lesson, the lecturer introduced us to the general structure of a research paper and what each part of it entails. The general structure of a research paper starts with the abstract then to the introduction that includes some background information. The most important part comes up next and it's the literature review. The last part is the personal perspective discussion that comes with recommendations to the issues discussed. This week's lesson was 3 hours long but it felt longer because of the content intensive topic. All in all, the lesson had been very useful because of the upcoming group research assignment.

The lesson on the Monday of the 3rd week was about the purpose of presentation, some generally useful presentation skills, some helpful slideshow tips and the art of doing a presentation. First off, we started by learning the purpose of a presentation. There are many purposes when one presents, to inform, instruct, inspire, etc. Each purpose has it's own kind of reason, tone and information. For example, the most basic, to inform is to present many facts and information to the audience about a topic with the purpose of increase their understanding about it. Another example is to persuade, this type of presentation is to give audience information about one side of an argument or problem in order to convince them about your stance. In the next part of the lesson we focus about the ones we're presenting to, the audience. The change in target audience can change ones presentation completely. While you present to different audiences, you change your tone, language and information. When presenting to younger audience, the tone would be more informal, the language would be easier to understand with few to none technical acronyms and there would be more information to explain more parts of the presentation. On the other hand, when presenting to older and expert audience, one would use a formal tone, many technical acronyms as they would've already been familiar with them and less information as they are familiar with the topic. The lecturer then taught us about the structure of a slideshow presentation and that although it can be flexible, it needs to be logical. The core of a presentation should include an introduction, procedure, results, discussion and conclusion. On top of that, the lecturer showed us how to create an optimal and comprehensible slideshow design. A good slideshow needs to have a clear font and font size, a background with a non conflicting colour, consistency and not too many animation and images. Last but not least, we move on to the do's and don'ts while doing a presentation. Overall, it is mainly about eye contact, body language, speech energy and preparedness. This week's lesson was especially useful due to the upcoming presentation. In just 3 hours, we learnt all about the fundamentals, useful skills and the composition of presentation.

The lesson on the Monday of the 4th week was about the fundamental of teamwork, the steps to developing a good team and how to resolve conflicts within a team. The lesson started off with the question "What is teamwork?". To answer the question, we first need to define what is a team. A team is a group of individuals tied together by the commitment to a common goal. Thus, teamwork defines as the ability cooperate and communicate with said group of people sharing the same goal. Next up, we learnt about the benefits of teamwork. As humans are social animals by design, there are many benefits to working in a team. A team would have higher efficiency and diversity. A team would work faster with lighter workload per individual and a teamwork in many cases would be an enjoyable and bonding experience. In the next part of the lesson, the lecturer taught us about the process of developing a team. There are 5 stages in team development which are Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing and lastly Adjourning. Firstly, in Forming, the team is created and roles get distributed. Secondly, in Brainstorming, the team face the reality of the assignment and starts finding solutions. Thirdly, in Norming, the team accepts the workload and idea of their assignment and starts working. Fourthly, in Performing, the work is in progress and team familiarize themselves with the workload and each other. Lastly, in Adjourning, the assignment is finished and team member acknowledges each other's hard work for closure. The lecturer then gave us a team role personality test to give us the general scope of who we are as a team member. In the last part of the lesson, we learn about how to deal with frictions within the team. There are 2 types of conflicts, task conflicts and emotional conflicts. Having different viewpoint and idea on a task can cause task conflict. On the other hand, emotional conflict is all about personal feelings, i.e. bad chemistry between teammates. The best way to resolve any kind of conflict is communication. One should intervene as early as possible and work through it as a team, having a mediator is highly recommended. This week's lesson ties together with the previous 3 lessons becoming extremely valuable for our group project. In the lesson, we learnt about teamwork, steps to developing a good team and conflict management.
